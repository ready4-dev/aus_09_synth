# aus_09_synth
Initial elements of a program to generate a synthetic representation of Australian Households in 2009.

This repository contains selected and edited elements of a larger program written by Glen Weisner and Matthew Hamilton in 2018-2020. The remaining elements of the program will be progressively added to this repository and retested in conjunction with the release of an R package of functions to implement the program.
